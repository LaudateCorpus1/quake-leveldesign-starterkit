v0.3
1. Fixed crash when triangulating a triangular brush.
2. Triangulation now default for ramp generation ("tri 1" statement not
   necessary anymore)
3. Triangulation for 5 sided brushes (Wedge Profile) now also possible.
4. Added "path" type (type 2) for arc generation. The path is being
   taken from an additional map file: mapname_path1.map, where "_path1"
   is the path of the respective arc #1, "_path2" of arc #2 and so forth.
   Map files that contain paths, can contain multiple seperated paths.
   Each one will be used by the respective arc.
5. Added "p_reverse" option for path extrusion mode. Activating it (1)
   will reverse the direction of a path.
6. Added "p_cornerfix" option for grid path extrusion mode ("type 2").
   When activated (1) it will fix overlapping meshes of "inside corners".
7. Added World-to-Face alignment conversion on map load.
8. Fixed minor texture misalignment issues.
9. Added "ramptex" setting to control texture alignment on ramps.
10.Added "p_split" setting to control whether a path object is split
   up into many smaller pieces or left in one piece on export.

v0.2a
1. Added Drag and Drop for map and txt files. When dropping map files,
   defaults.txt will always be used for settings if it exists. Otherwise
   internal defaults will be used.
2. Added Solid Entity Support. Point Entities are still being ignored
   at the moment, but might be considered in a future update.
3. Added Custom Height command "height", which is being added to each section.
4. Added round coordinates command "round" (0/1).
5. Added "ramp" as an addition to "height". Usable with linear (1) and
   smooth (2) slope.
6. Added Triangulation "tri" (0/1) for 6 sided Brushes only (Cuboids).
   Neccessary for ramp generation.
7. Fixed settings file issue.
8. Fixed invalid Brush issue.

v0.11a
1. Fixed WAD detection and file-paths issues.
2. Drag&Drop works for map files now, too. Settings are then being
   taken from defaults.txt in Map2Curve root folder, if available.
3. Added CreateWAD.exe, which will create a text file "wad_custom.txt"
   from a folder of BMP files. See its README for further information.
