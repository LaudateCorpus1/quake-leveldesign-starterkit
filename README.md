## Prerequisites

You need Git and a legal copy of [Quake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)). You can buy one on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2310/) and [Good Old Games](https://www.gog.com/game/quake_the_offering) platforms.

## Installation

Open a Terminal session and clone this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/jonathanlinat/quake-leveldesign-starterkit.git
```

Open `quake-leveldesign-starterkit` folder in Windows Explorer.

Create a new folder called `id1`. Then, copy and paste into this one the original `pak0.pak` and `pak1.pak` files from your Quake game copy. These are required in order to be able to play the original game using `Quakespasm`.

Also, create a folder called `maps` into the `id1` folder. This is the folder used to save the compiled maps.
