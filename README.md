## Prerequisites

You need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and a legal copy of [Quake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)). You can buy one on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2310) or [Good Old Games](https://www.gog.com/game/quake_the_offering).

## Installation

### Download

You have two options:

* Download the [latest available ZIP release](https://github.com/jonathanlinat/quake-leveldesign-starterkit/releases) and extract its content into a folder called `quake-leveldesign-starterkit`.
* Open a Terminal session and clone this Git repository.

### Configuration

Locate and open `quake-leveldesign-starterkit` folder in Windows Explorer.

Create three new folders:

* The first one called `working`, located at the root directory. It'll remain empty until `ne_q1spCompilingGui` tool is used.
* The second one called `id1`, also located at the root directory.
* And the last one called `maps` into the `id1` folder. This is the folder used to save the compiled maps.

Last but not least, copy and paste into `id1` folder the original `pak0.pak` and `pak1.pak` files from your Quake game copy location. These are required in order to be able to test your map using `Quakespasm`.
