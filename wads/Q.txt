Q.wad


This is the wadfile I use.  It's clean, contains id, hipnotic, rogue
and ctf4 textures, and is only 5 megs (as apposed to merging all these
wads together, making 10 megs).  It took me a few hours, but I managed
to clean out duplicates, duplicates with a different name and textures
which are rarely used.  Bonuses are all the item textures (health packs
et al), and even some id textures that were not in any of the original
Quake wads (e.g. the yellow lights from American's Dm4.)  I decided to
make this wad to eliminate the chances of using two identical textures
with different names (which can significantlly raise the size of your
bsp for nothing.)  And also because 5 megs is sweeter on an editor than
10 (which would make editing slower), and because I felt all the *good*
textures really only needed to be in *one* wad.  Hence, Q.wad.
